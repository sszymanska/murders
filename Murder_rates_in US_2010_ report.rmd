## Introduction

Report on 2010 gun murder rates obtained from FBI reports. The original data was obtained from



We are going to use the following library:


```{r loading-libs, message = FALSE}
library (tidyverse)
```
and load the data we already wangled : 

```{r}
load("rda/murders.rda")

```

## Murder rate by state 

We note the large state to state variability by generating a barplot showing the murder rate by state: 



```{r murder-rate-by-state, echo=FALSE}
murders %>% mutate(abb = reorder(abb,rate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(abb,rate)) +
  geom_bar(width = 0.5, stat = "identity", color ="black")+
  coord_flip()

```
